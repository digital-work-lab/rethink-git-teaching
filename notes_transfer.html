				<h2>Transfer Knowledge in Git Learning</h2>
				<ul>
				        <li><strong>First we created a setting for Transfer Knowledge Development:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Students explore questions involving concepts from different Git areas.</li>
				                <li>Utilizes diverse and unconnected problem sets that are challenging to combine into a coherent case exercise.</li>
				                <li>Proposes the use of hypothetical scenarios and an array of transfer questions.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Order of Git Areas:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Proceed from transfer questions related to branching and committing, to branching and collaborating, and finally to committing and collaborating.</li>
				                <li>Table 2 provides example questions for each transfer block and the rationale for their order.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Process of Solving Transfer Questions:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Provide students with a scenario and the transfer question.</li>
				                <li>Solutions may involve:
				                    <ul>
				                        <li>Intuition based on pre-existing knowledge of Git concepts.</li>
				                        <li>Consultation of the official Git manual pages.</li>
				                        <li>A web search.</li>
				                        <li>Testing outcomes in an example repository.</li>
				                    </ul>
				                </li>
				                <li>Given the challenging nature, provide students with a detailed solution to revisit after the session.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Benefits of Connective Thinking Mode:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Helps students comprehend various Git issues that arise from multiple areas.</li>
				                <li>Necessary for deeper understanding of Git and rationalizing issues at the intersection of different areas.</li>
				                <li>Example: Rewriting branch histories in collaborative settings.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Holistic Understanding of Git:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Encourages thinking in a more connected way.</li>
				                <li>Helps tackle complex issues with a comprehensive perspective.</li>
				                <li>Enhances proficiency in using Git beyond just software development.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				    </ul>
