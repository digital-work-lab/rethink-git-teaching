				<p>In each of the three Git areas, we suggest to start by explaining the key concepts and have students practice them afterwards.</p>
				
				<hr>
				<h3>Conceptual learning</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Illustrate concepts dynamically, for instance on a whiteboard with magnetic arrows representing branches</li>
					<li>Avoid static slides or pure cli illustrations</li>
					<li>Two-pronged approach: focused and dynamic illustration of key concepts followed by practice sessions in small groups.</li>
					<li>Begins with concept teaching, prioritizing comprehension of fundamental models like the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG).</li>
					<li>Static slides often fall short in teaching complex, dynamic concepts like Git.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr>
				<h3>Interactive learning</h3>
				<p>To facilitate interactive group-based learning, we recommend to create self-contained learning environments</p>
