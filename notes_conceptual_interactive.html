				<h2>2. From conceptual to inter-active learning</h2>
				<p>In each of the three Git areas, we suggest to start by explaining the key concepts and have students practice them afterwards.</p>

				<p>Conceptual part</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Illustrate concepts dynamically, for instance on a whiteboard with magnetic arrows representing branches</li>
					<li>Avoid static slides or pure cli illustrations</li>
					<li>Two-pronged approach: focused and dynamic illustration of key concepts followed by practice sessions in small groups.</li>
					<li>Begins with concept teaching, prioritizing comprehension of fundamental models like the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG).</li>
					<li>Static slides often fall short in teaching complex, dynamic concepts like Git.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>Group-based interactive learning</p>
				<ul>
					<li>learn-git-branching</li>
					<li>creating changes (example)</li>
					<li>Git collaboration game</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note: we recommend to create self-contained learning environments</p>


				<p>TODO : INTERGRATE THE FOLLOWING</p>

                <p>Suggestions for self-contained practice environments</p>

                    <li>TBD: small games?</li>
                    <li>On-paper exercises to construct a Git graph from commands vice versa</li>
