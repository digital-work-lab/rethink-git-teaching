				<h2>Two-Pronged Approach for Git Learning</h2>
				<ul>
				        <li><strong>...</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Two-pronged approach: focused and dynamic illustration of key concepts followed by practice sessions in small groups.</li>
				                <li>Begins with concept teaching, prioritizing comprehension of fundamental models like the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG).</li>
				                <li>Static slides often fall short in teaching complex, dynamic concepts like Git.</li>
				                <li>Split attention can interfere with learning and hinder comprehension.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>We thought about an Interactive, Hands-On Learning Approaches:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Creates engaging, immersive learning experiences for deeper understanding and mastery.</li>
				                <li>Dynamic live demonstrations are more instructive than static slides.</li>
				                <li>Incorporates practical sessions to gamify learning with diverse groups and interactive settings (e.g., open-source collaboration games).</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Practical Sessions:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Allow students to assume different roles and engage actively with the material.</li>
				                <li>Cover Git conventions and sensitize students to poor practices.</li>
				                <li>Aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>We focus on Areas for Learning:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Students should grasp branching without creating file changes or authenticating for remote connections.</li>
				                <li>Learn collaboration techniques (e.g., pull requests) without mandatory time investment in creating local commits, performing authentication, establishing connections, and pushing changes to remote repositories.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				        <li><strong>Our Ultimate Goal is:</strong>
				            <ul>
				                <li>Combine theoretical understanding with hands-on practice.</li>
				                <li>Foster collaboration and engagement.</li>
				                <li>Prepare students for real-world scenarios in their field of study.</li>
				            </ul>
				        </li>
				    </ul>
