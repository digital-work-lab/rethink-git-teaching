				<h2>2. From conceptual to inter-active learning</h2>
				<p>In each of the three Git areas, we suggest to start by explaining the key concepts and have students practice them afterwards.</p>

				<p>Conceptual part</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Illustrate concepts dynamically, for instance on a whiteboard with magnetic arrows representing branches</li>
					<li>Avoid static slides or pure cli illustrations</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Group-based interactive learning</p>
				<ul>
					<li>learn-git-branching</li>
					<li>creating changes (example)</li>
					<li>Git collaboration game</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note: we recommend to create self-contained learning environments</p>


				<p>TODO : INTERGRATE THE FOLLOWING</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>...</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Two-pronged approach: focused and dynamic illustration of key concepts followed by practice sessions in small groups.</li>
							<li>Begins with concept teaching, prioritizing comprehension of fundamental models like the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG).</li>
							<li>Static slides often fall short in teaching complex, dynamic concepts like Git.</li>
							<li>Split attention can interfere with learning and hinder comprehension.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>We thought about an Interactive, Hands-On Learning Approaches:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Creates engaging, immersive learning experiences for deeper understanding and mastery.</li>
							<li>Dynamic live demonstrations are more instructive than static slides.</li>
							<li>Incorporates practical sessions to gamify learning with diverse groups and interactive settings (e.g., open-source collaboration games).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Practical Sessions:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Allow students to assume different roles and engage actively with the material.</li>
							<li>Cover Git conventions and sensitize students to poor practices.</li>
							<li>Aim to provide a comprehensive learning experience.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>We focus on Areas for Learning:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Students should grasp branching without creating file changes or authenticating for remote connections.</li>
							<li>Learn collaboration techniques (e.g., pull requests) without mandatory time investment in creating local commits, performing authentication, establishing connections, and pushing changes to remote repositories.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Our Ultimate Goal is:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Combine theoretical understanding with hands-on practice.</li>
							<li>Foster collaboration and engagement.</li>
							<li>Prepare students for real-world scenarios in their field of study.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
