				<h2>1. Reorder areas</h2>
                <p>We suggest to rearrange the order in which the Git areas are introduced, starting with branching, and proceeding with committing and collaborating. In the following, we summarize the key contents that should be covered in each area, as well as best practices to create self-contained learning environments.</p>
                <h3>Area: Branching</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commits, branch pointers, Git graph, merges</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suggestions for self-contained practice environments</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=de_DE">learngitbranching.js.org</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Area: Committing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suggestions for self-contained practice environments</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Area: Collaborating</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suggestions for self-contained practice environments</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GitHub online (simplified, without a staging area)</li>
