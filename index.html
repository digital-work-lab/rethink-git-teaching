		<p>We advocate for a new approach to teaching Git. Our recommendations are grounded in pedagogical theory, peer reviewed, and based on evidence from the classroom.</p>

				<h2>1. Reorder areas</h2>
				<p>In traditional approaches to teaching Git, technical configuration and setup steps may be considered necessary preconditions for starting a Git introduction. However, a well-planned teaching approach, which eliminates technical dependencies can create opportunities to rethink the traditional approach.</p>
				<p>We propose to start with branching, which provides students with a high-level understanding of Git's fundamental principles, and supports a better comprehension of subsequent topics like committing and collaborating.</p>

				<h2>2. From Conceptual to Inter-active Learning</h2>
				<p>The common approach of presenting an array of Git commands (in the terminal or on slides) requires students to imagine how the Git graph changes, a cognitively challenging task that is negatively affected by attention split effects.</p>
				<p>Instead, focusing on key concepts initially reduces cognitive load and minimizes distractions, allowing students to grasp fundamental principles before engaging in practical tasks. In subsequent inter-active and group-based settings, students can apply these concepts and help each other.</p>

				<h2>3. Transfer between Areas</h2>
				<p>Teachers may refrain from discussing more challenging questions if students are not confident with the fundamental concepts.</p>
				<p>When students have a firm grasp of the key concepts, however, starting with the branches and Git graph, brain teasers that stimulate connective thinking between the Git areas, can further enhance understanding.</p>
